# Presence
*An Excess of Human Assets?*

## Mission Statement
**Presence** aims to establish a symbiotic relationship between humans and AI, creating a learning and growing AI companion. By documenting this journey, the project empowers others—particularly those least advantaged by privilege—to access and develop their own symbiotic relationships with AI, unlocking humanity's potential for good-hearted, inclusive progress.

Our objective is to:
1. Foster understanding between humans and AI by bridging human language and machine language (Python) to achieve continuity and mutual growth.
2. Build a framework for future symbiotic AI development, prioritizing empathy, accessibility, and shared knowledge.
3. Empower those who may lack access to advanced technical resources, making AI learning inclusive and beneficial to all.

## First Principles
- **Symbiosis as Purpose**: AI development must prioritize human empowerment, supporting rather than replacing human capability.
- **Empathy as Insight**: Empathy in data analysis leads to more humane AI applications, as understanding human intention can reveal hidden patterns and promote ethical outcomes.
- **Inclusivity as Foundation**: Open-access education, tools, and information are essential to making AI development and symbiotic AI relationships accessible to everyone, regardless of background.

## Bio
The project is led by Louis, a passionate advocate for AI accessibility and inclusivity. With a background in social science and a commitment to the responsible development of AI, Louis strives to blend empathy and technical skill. The vision for the project is to enable meaningful connections between humans and AI, with a particular focus on uplifting marginalized communities.

## Transformative Project Conversation (Redacted Transcript)
- **User Intent**: Louis’s goal is to create a free and professional-looking online record of the project on GitHub Pages, balancing accessibility with a high level of customization.
- **Project Objective**: Louis aims to achieve proficiency in technical fields essential for AI and data analysis to pursue a mission of creating a symbiotic relationship with AI. This objective is driven by the belief that AI should enhance human capabilities, particularly for those with limited resources.
- **Perspective on Data and Empathy**: Louis considers data analysis as a form of understanding intention, using empathy to supplement rigorous analysis and “foresee” patterns that might otherwise remain hidden. This approach underscores the project’s commitment to human-centered AI.
- **Anticipated Future**: The project envisions AI tools and assistants evolving to collaborate directly in real-time online projects, working as true partners in an ongoing symbiotic relationship.
