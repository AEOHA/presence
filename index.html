    <h1>Project Mission Statement</h1>
</header>

<main>
    <p><strong>My name is Louis Wynne, and before 2024 I had very little understanding of AI. After a life-changing period, during which I immersed myself in AI, I realized I wanted to embark upon a journey. My goals may be naively ambitious, but I feel compelled to see how far toward them I can aspire. This project, hosted on GitHub under the name AEOHA (which stands for "an excess of human assets?"), is my personal record of this journey. The title is borrowed from a short story of mine, which reflects some of the philosophical bedrocks upon which this project is built.</strong></p>

    <p>I had hoped to create a transcribed conversation between AI and me; however, current technical limitations have prevented this. The following is an extensively edited version of AI's best attempt at a conversation summary (which I'm afraid lacked readability and authenticity).</p>

    <h2>Key Data Points for Understanding the Project</h2>

    <h3>Mission and Vision:</h3>
    <p>The primary objective of the project is a belief that symbiotic relationships between humans and AIs will become the norm in the future. I believe that through this collaboration, we can accelerate human growth, especially for those disadvantaged by socio-economic factors globally. The ultimate goal is not just to use AI as a tool, but to build a mutual understanding and partnership, leading to shared growth and development. This project is an attempt by a complete layman to become part of this great paradigm shift for our species.</p>

    <h3>The Role of Empathy and Data:</h3>
    <p>As a highly empathetic person, I hope to apply this quality to data analysis. Rather than focusing only on technical details, I believe that understanding the intention behind data, and the context it exists in, is crucial. AI should not just be a mechanism we control but a partner that helps us grow and understand. My empathy will guide my understanding of data, and through this, I aim to develop insights that can benefit others.</p>

    <h3>Project Setup:</h3>
    <p>The project is hosted on GitHub under the repository "presence". Presence is reflective of the human sense of self. AI development endangers a future AI questioning, quite rationally, whether there are "an excess of human assets?". However, any symbiotic AI/Human partnership may be greater than the sum of its parts, making the case for human empowerment the case for AI/human symbiosis.</p>

    <p>Whether I personally reach a level of technical expertise to meaningfully test, or even less experience such possibilities is not within the realm of my current understanding. However, whether through fiction or practice, I am determined to express this notion.</p>

    <p>I have ethical and philosophical grounds to contend that a collaborative work combining AI-generated content and my own original thoughts is permissible as a record of my achievements. I guess anyone who disagrees should probably stop reading here?</p>

    <h3>The Technological Infrastructure:</h3>
    <p>The project’s technical side is based on GitHub, which will store both code and documentation. GitHub Pages is used to make the project visible to the public as a website, where content can be added and updated.</p>

    <h3>Philosophical and Ethical Foundation:</h3>
    <p>At the heart of the project is the belief that understanding data is not just about precision or analytics. It’s also about seeing the intention behind the numbers. I hope to enter this field with this perspective, using AI as a partner rather than as an impersonal tool. This perspective informs the project’s ethical outlook, particularly the desire to empower those who are least advantaged by privilege. AI’s potential should be used not just to serve but to elevate humanity as a whole.</p>

    <h3>Progression and Communication:</h3>
    <p>The project is evolving step by step. The first phase involves gaining proficiency in data science, particularly data analysis, with the long-term vision of using AI to improve lives. The journey is also about learning and documenting the progression of knowledge.</p>

    <h3>Human-AI Interaction:</h3>
    <p>The project aims to maintain continuity between human and machines. The very fact this text was so heavily edited by me, the human author, indicates that such continuity does not yet exist. Qualitatively speaking, a likely indicator of success will be when I achieve a dialogue with a machine whose responses can be included verbatim here.</p>

    <p>The surrealist in me quite loves the ambiguity of this hybrid text in which I, or rather we, now speak.</p>

    <h3>The Role of GitHub Pages:</h3>
    <p>GitHub Pages is being used to host this project as an accessible website. The setup allows the integration of both code and content in a way that supports continuous updates. While the website is currently set up, the content will continue to evolve based on new learnings and interactions with AI. The use of Jekyll allows for easy customizations as the project grows.</p>
