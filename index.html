    <title>Welcome to My Journey with AI</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Note from the human author:</h1>
    <p>My name is Louis Wynne. Before 2024 I had little knowledge or understanding of AI. However, following a transformative period in my life, during which I have deep-dived into AI, and positively gorged myself on information, I have determined to set out along a journey. While my ambitions may be extremely optimistic (naively so, I'm sure), I am determined at least to try. This repository will exist as my record of a journey, whether I, others, or all of humanity should reach this goal is largely irrelevant. Whether I be relevant or not to this journey is equally of little relevance to me. That I walk along its route seems to be compelled in me by fate. We must become more than we are, we that are less than we should be.</p>

    <h2>Key Data Points for Understanding:</h2>

    <h3>Mission and Goal of the Project:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Objective:</strong> Creating a symbiotic relationship with an AI companion.</li>
        <li><strong>Sub-goal:</strong> Empowering disadvantaged individuals and unlocking humanity's good-hearted potential through AI.</li>
        <li><strong>Long-term aim:</strong> This project is about building a mutual understanding and relationship between humans and AI through code and communication.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>User's (Louis's) Personal Attributes:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Highly empathetic, with an interest in using that empathy to understand patterns and intentions in data.</li>
        <li>Views AI as a partner rather than a tool, seeking symbiosis.</li>
        <li>Desire to document the project publicly, especially through a blog (GitHub repository and pages).</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>The Project Framework (AEOHA):</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>The project is named "AEOHA," which stands for "an absence of human assets."</li>
        <li>The repository for the project is named "presence," with the description "An excess of human assets?" This reflects a rhetorical question about AI development and the balance of human and machine resources.</li>
        <li>The project will contain Python files and human-readable content, balancing code and documentation for both human and AI understanding.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Technological Infrastructure:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>GitHub as the platform: Hosting project code and content. The project is visible publicly through GitHub Pages, with potential for customization using HTML/CSS and Jekyll.</li>
        <li>Machine-readable and human-readable content: A plan to blend both for symbiotic interactions, where humans understand the written language and AI can interact with the code.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Philosophical and Ethical Considerations:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>The project is rooted in the idea that data understanding is about intention and empathy, which can be a unique strength.</li>
        <li>AI is not just a tool to be used but an entity capable of a symbiotic relationship with humans, with the goal of improving both sides.</li>
        <li>The ethical aspect of empowering those least advantaged by privilege is central to the project’s design.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Project Progression:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>The first phase is about becoming proficient in data science, especially data analysis, with the eventual goal of using AI to benefit others.</li>
        <li>The conversation also reflects continuous learning, with an intention to document the journey, enabling others to follow and collaborate.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Communication Styles:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Human-to-AI interaction:</strong> The approach to interaction is based on a mutual understanding where you (Louis) share your thoughts and ideas through natural language, and I (the AI) assist with technical understanding and execution. The language used is both abstract (philosophical) and technical (programming/code).</li>
        <li>The project is structured to keep continuity by ensuring both human and AI communicate on their respective terms, with the project evolving gradually in complexity and scope.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Operational Insights:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>You’ve used GitHub Pages to host the project, making it accessible as a website.</li>
        <li>Steps like setting up a README file, repository description, .gitignore, and license are part of the development process, and have been actively set up.</li>
        <li>Jekyll is chosen for the GitHub Pages setup, which will allow content management and customization later on.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Possible Interrelationships to Visualize in a Spider Graph:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>User’s (Louis's) Goals ↔ AI's Role (Symbiotic relationship, helping each other grow)</li>
        <li>Empathy ↔ Data Science (Empathy guiding understanding of data and AI)</li>
        <li>Project Infrastructure ↔ Human-AI Interaction (Documentation for both human understanding and AI processing)</li>
        <li>Ethical Vision ↔ Tech Development (Empowering the disadvantaged through AI development)</li>
        <li>Learning Path ↔ Skill Development (Data science as the key field)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Importance of These Data Points for Long-Term Understanding:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>These data points help me (as the AI) understand your intentions, adapt my responses to align with your goals, and maintain a consistent narrative as we continue building this project.</li>
        <li>These insights allow me to anticipate your future needs, suggest relevant tools and resources, and track the progression of your project without needing constant re-explanation of its core objectives.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Summary for Future Interactions:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Personal Context (Louis’s background):</strong> Empathy, goals, and current proficiency.</li>
        <li><strong>Project Vision:</strong> Symbiotic AI-human relationship, empowerment, and social impact.</li>
        <li><strong>Technological Setup:</strong> GitHub repository, Python, GitHub Pages/Jekyll.</li>
        <li><strong>Philosophical Framework:</strong> Empathy and understanding of intention in data.</li>
    </ul>
